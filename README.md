## Overview

This Plasma applet provides an easy way to:
- **View** the current platform profile at a glance
- **Monitor** profile changes made via Fn+Q keyboard shortcut (on supported devices)
- **Display** all available platform profiles

### What are Platform Profiles?

Platform profiles control the performance and power behavior of your system through ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface). Common profiles include:

- **Performance**: Maximum performance, higher power consumption
- **Balanced**: Balance between performance and power efficiency
- **Low-Power/Quiet**: Power saving mode with reduced performance

## Features

- üéØ **Quick Access**: Panel icon shows current profile at a glance
- üîç **Visual Feedback**: Color-coded profiles and icons
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Fn+Q Compatible**: Automatically detects profile changes from keyboard shortcuts
- üìä **Real-time Updates**: Monitors profile changes every 5 seconds
- üñ•Ô∏è **Read-only Display**: Shows available profiles without allowing changes (use Fn+Q to change profiles)

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- Linux system with ACPI platform profile support
- `/sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile` file must exist
- `/sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile_choices` file must exist

### Software Requirements
- KDE Plasma 6.x (primary support)
- Qt 6.x
- `kpackagetool6` (for installation)

**Note**: This version is designed for Plasma 6. For Plasma 5 support, please use an older release.

### Check System Compatibility

To check if your system supports platform profiles:

```bash
# Check if platform profile files exist
ls -l /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile*

# View current profile
cat /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile

# View available profiles
cat /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile_choices
```

## Installation

### Automatic Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Scott-Nx/Platform-Profile_Applet.git
   cd Platform-Profile_Applet
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. Add the widget to your panel:
   - Right-click on your KDE panel
   - Select "Add Widgets..."
   - Search for "Platform Profile"
   - Drag it to your panel or desktop

### Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually:

```bash
# For Plasma 6
kpackagetool6 -t Plasma/Applet -i package

# For Plasma 5
kpackagetool5 -t Plasma/Applet -i package
```

### Updating

To update the applet:

```bash
git pull
./install.sh
```

The installation script will automatically remove the old version before installing the new one.

## Uninstallation

Run the uninstallation script:

```bash
./uninstall.sh
```

Or manually:

```bash
# For Plasma 6
kpackagetool6 -t Plasma/Applet -r org.kde.plasma.platformprofile

# For Plasma 5
kpackagetool5 -t Plasma/Applet -r org.kde.plasma.platformprofile
```

## Usage

### Panel Icon

The panel icon displays:
- An icon representing the current profile
- A badge with abbreviated profile name:
  - **P**: Performance
  - **B**: Balanced
  - **LP**: Low-Power
  - **Q**: Quiet

### Popup Interface

Click the panel icon to open the popup interface, which shows:
- Current profile name (color-coded)
- List of all available profiles with icons
- Active profile marked with "‚úì (Active)"

### Changing Profiles

**Use the Fn+Q keyboard shortcut** on your Lenovo device to cycle through available profiles. The applet will automatically detect and display the change within 5 seconds.

**Note**: This applet is read-only and monitors profile changes. It does not provide GUI buttons to change profiles. Use your device's hardware controls (Fn+Q) to switch profiles.

## Troubleshooting

### Applet shows "Error accessing platform profile"

**Cause**: The system doesn't support ACPI platform profiles or files are not accessible.

**Solutions**:
- Verify files exist: `ls -l /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile*`
- Check your hardware supports this feature (common on Lenovo laptops)
- Ensure ACPI is enabled in BIOS/UEFI

### Applet doesn't appear in widget list

**Cause**: Installation failed or Plasma needs restart.

**Solutions**:
- Restart Plasma: `plasmashell --replace &`
- Or log out and log back in
- Verify installation: `kpackagetool6 -t Plasma/Applet -s org.kde.plasma.platformprofile`

### Profile changes not reflected

**Cause**: Delayed update or permission issues.

**Solutions**:
- Wait a few seconds (updates every 5 seconds)
- Check manually: `cat /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile`
- Verify file permissions on platform_profile files
